# Installation

```bash
yarn add -D file:local-types/screenfull
```

## Summary

This package contains type definitions for [screenfull.js](<(https://github.com/sindresorhus/screenfull.js)>).
The original types are located at [DefinitelyTyped/screenfull](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/types/screenfull), but a minimal modification was locally performed, thus creating this module.

## Details

Files were originally exported from [DefinitelyTyped/screenfull](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/types/screenfull)

Local details

- Changed the export instruction from `export = screenfull` to `export default screenfull` in order to solve build issues with `ng-packagr`
